# bankSystem

Bank application with Spring Boot. 

This Spring Boot application is designed to manage a bank system. It comprises three main classes: Account, Bank, and Transaction.

For each class, a comprehensive structure has been implemented, consisting of models, services, controllers, and repositories.

Model: Defines the structure and attributes of each entity.

Service: Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Basically handles user operations, allowing them to manage accounts, banks, and transactions.

Controller: The controller layer defines endpoints that handle HTTP requests from clients.

Repository: Utilizes Spring Data MongoDB repositories to seamlessly integrate database operations.
